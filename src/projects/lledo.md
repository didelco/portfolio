context: 'Since 1958 Lledó is a company with extensive experience in the design and manufacture of luminaires for architecture.
They have a wide catalog of products that can be adapted to the needs of the project, generally focused on a professional audience in the world of lighting that demands custom-made products, high-quality finishes and personalized service.'
challenges: 'Currently in addition to the usual professional client with large orders, personalized products and individually negotiated prices, lledo now wants to expand its audience. Now they also want to approach smaller clients such as small architecture and decoration studios and even end clients who need advice, a well-defined catalog and prices on the web./The end customer who they also want to address from lledo needs more information on basic aspects of lighting and advice to know the different articles in the catalog and in which case to use each one./

The way to navigate the current catalog is quite complex, even for the most professional clients. In fact most of the time the argument for choosing one luminaire over another depends on very technical and specific features that are difficult to find in the product sheets. In these technical specificities are the details that will make the difference compared to other more generic luminaires./These challenges were the insights that we obtained in a series of investigations, interviews and benchmarks with different types of stakeholders.'

solutions: 'Once we knew from the research the archetype of people we were targeting and knowing where we wanted to position ourselves against the competition, we were able to find the actions that we had to execute:/

- Reduce the offer of the catalog, standardizing the characteristics, fixed prices and establishing delivery time for online sales. In the usual channels you could continue with all the customization and normal procedure./
- Facilitate the choice of luminaires with different tools./
- Improving the perceived quality of the product: Improving the brand, creating inspiring quality content and help tools that allow us to better understand the advantages of Lledó luminaires/

In order to empathize more with clients with less knowledge about lighting, we try to show the luminaires in a less technical way and carry out didactic work to teach the client the differences between the different characteristics so that they can choose the luminaire they need./

For this work we created tools such as moodwalls with light effects similar to Pinterest, which is a well-known reference, but in this case only with light effects. Another of the tools were luminaire configurators to be able to navigate the catalog more easily, choosing the aesthetic characteristics and lighting properties that you need./

Focusing on the target user of our platform, we also created specific sites such as Lledó Life or Sistemas lineares, which were independent sites, which showed only part of the lledo catalog but had a very clear value proposition offering more design and a selection of products. very specific for the users we are addressing.'
