## Context

Datadis is a platform created by distribution companies to simplify access to consumer data. Users can check all electrical contracts in your name from a single site, regardles of company contracted. 
					
When contacting us, they had a clear intention to improve the user experience of their website.


											
## Chalenges
the challenges are many and varied. The web existed when we started working on it, and the architecture did not work.
							
In addition to the structure, the way of addressing the user was not appropriate, we had to be precise with the terms used, but move away from the language excessively technical and legal. 

User registration was a very complex process, it was necessary to verify the identity of the person or companies that registered.
 
We had to design the platform for very different user profiles with different use of the platform and information they consult. 
							
We cannot save any user data in the database, which forced us to load all the data every time, causing very high loading times and loss of data. alerts when somethinggoes wrong.


										
## Solutions

To troubleshoot this project we had to go a bit further than we usually need to go into projects.
						 
We had to go deep inside Datadis to understand the processes within Datadis and discover that exceptions were the rule and the validation process It required many
manual steps, which we proceeded to categorize, group, and simplify the number of cases, but we could not automate them.
				
To simplify registration, we had to go through all the cases on similar websites to identify opportunities to simplify the process.

And we also had to go further in the field of programming by proposing strategies to reduce the time of calls to the API, such as changing the order of calls using
Bayesian methods to reduce loading time most of the time.
		
We dove into designing the API, both the documentation and the call nomenclature.

And many other things that if you want to discover in more detail you can read the full case
